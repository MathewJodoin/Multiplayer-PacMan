# Multiplayer-PacMan
Re-Creation of the popular game using Java Swing and adding multiplayer functionality

This project is to re-create PacMan using only Java and Swing.  Nothing earth shattering there.  The map will be created using a 2 dimensional array of JPanels.

The multiplayer functionality be done using TCP/IP sockets and a designated server.  The only information necessary to transmit is the player position as well as the power pellets taken from the map.

Other than that, use your imagination.  Should be a fun project!
